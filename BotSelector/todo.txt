TODO:

Enlarge screen, and allow movement around it.
Get bots accelerating and decelerating.
Same species bots should mate.
Bots can hunt each other or food specks.
Start adding attributes - it's worth considering which attributes to add before this
Change the triangle shape, it's boring!!

Bots should rely less on colour and more on species - full tree should be implemented! 
	Kingdom - Topmost division. Animals are animalia.
	Phylum (division for plants) - Phylum cordata has mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians.
	Class - Similar orders, e.g. mammals.
	Order - Similar families, e.g. felidae are Carnivora order.
	Family - A group of similar genus, e.g. felidae has cats and leopard
	Genus - 1 or more similar species, e.g. Panthera has lion and tiger
	Species - Similar form, shape and reproductive features

Implement bot attributes:
	Aggressiveness
	Horniness
	Hunger
	Metabolism
	Size
	Colour
	Shape and relation to food level
	Fluorescence
	Socialability
	Cannibalism
	Strength - forward
	Agility - turning speed
	
	
Thoughts:
	Create fields based on specks
	Create wells and hills based on specks/bots

Create different enums for different event types

Theory for hunting bots (maybe as an initial solution which can be improved):
	- Detect smaller bots within radius
	- Calculate probability of hunting bot based on aggressiveness
	- Follow probability 
Accelerate bots towards other bots if hunting, decelerate if there is nothing
