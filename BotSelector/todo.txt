Enlarge screen, and allow movement around it.
Same species bots should mate.
Change the triangle shape, it's boring!!

Bots should rely less on colour and more on species - full tree should be implemented! 
	Kingdom - Topmost division. Animals are animalia.
	Phylum (division for plants) - Phylum cordata has mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians.
	Class - Similar orders, e.g. mammals.

	Genus - 1 or more similar species, e.g. Panthera has lion and tiger
	Species - Similar form, shape and reproductive features

	Horniness
	Hunger
	Metabolism
	Size
	Colour
	Shape and relation to food level
	Fluorescence
	Socialability
	Cannibalism
	Strength - forward
